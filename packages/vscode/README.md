# MDXTab VS Code Extension (Spike)

MDXTab stands for MarkDown eXtended Tables.

- Command: **MDXTab: Render Preview** (`mdxtab.renderPreview`) — renders the active Markdown file through the MDXTab compiler into a preview document.
- Diagnostics: recompiles on open/change/save; errors surface as markdown diagnostics at the top of the file.
- Preview scheme: `mdxtab-preview:` opens a virtual document with the rendered output (frontmatter + interpolated aggregates).

This is a spike; packaging, icons, and richer error mapping are still TBD.

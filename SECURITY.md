If you discover a security issue, please report it privately.

## Supported versions
We provide security updates for the latest released version. Older versions may not receive fixes.

We welcome good-faith security research and will not take action against responsible reporting.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- Include steps to reproduce, affected versions, impact (if known), and any relevant logs or proof of concept.

## Response timeline
